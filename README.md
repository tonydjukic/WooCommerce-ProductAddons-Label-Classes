WooCommerce-ProductAddons-Label-Classes
=======================================
*** For clarification:  This is NOT the WooCommerce Product Add-ons Plugin/Extension; these are just edited template files that give unique CSS classes to the labels for each input.  You MUST first purchase the actual WooCommerce Product Add-ons extension, otherwise these files here will be useless to you. ***

*** Remember to update these files after every update of the WooCommerce Product-Addons plugin is performed.***

The WooCommerce Product Add-Ons plugin/extension allows you to label the input fields, however, the labels themselves don't have classes. The included template files add an additional bit of code that uses the product add-ons name to create a unique label class for each input, thus allowing for much simpler styling via CSS.

The WooCommerce Product Add-Ons plugin/extension is a 'commercial' extension that can be purchased from WooThemes; as such, what I've included here are JUST the template files.  You will need to purchase the extension yourself and then replace the existing template files (located in 'wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-product-addons/templates/addons').

These files will NOT work as a standalone and are just a modification to the original WooThemes Product Add-ons plugin.

Get the full extension here before attempting to use these files: http://www.woothemes.com/products/product-add-ons/

The following files do not need to be replaced because they are no different than the original WooCommerce Product-Addons version:
- addon-end.php
- addon-start.php
- select.php

Updated to match WooCommerce Product-Addons version 2.6.6
